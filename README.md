###Car Price Prediction - Streamlit App<br>

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Car Price Prediction Streamlit App! This project aims to provide a user-friendly web application that predicts the price of a car based on various features. The app is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web applications.

###Features

Predict the price of a car based on its features.
Explore the dataset and visualize the data.
Input various car features, such as mileage, brand, year, and more, to get an estimated price.
The app uses a trained machine-learning model to make predictions.
Model Deployment
We are pleased to announce that the project has been successfully deployed using Streamlit. You can access the live deployment of the Car Price Prediction model by following this link: https://datasciencecapstoneproject-rzaashif.streamlit.app/

###Usage
Once you access the Streamlit app, you will be able to interact with the model's user-friendly interface. Simply input the relevant features of the car you want to predict the price for, and the model will provide you with an estimated price based on the trained data. Feel free to experiment with different combinations of features and explore the model's performance.
